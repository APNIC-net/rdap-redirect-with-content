Abstract

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to
   provide access to their resource registration information.  When an
   RDAP service operator has delegated authority for a resource to a
   third party, the operator will configure its RDAP service to redirect
   requests for that resource to the third party.  However, the client
   may be interested in the resource registration data that the first
   service operator has in its own right, for various reasons.  This
   document defines a conformance code that a service operator can use
   to indicate that when redirecting requests, it will also include as
   the body of the response the RDAP object (if any) that it has in its
   own right for the requested resource.

1.  Introduction

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) [RFC7480] is used by
   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs)
   to provide access to their resource registration information.  For a
   client, this typically involves following the bootstrap process
   [RFC7484] to determine the base URL for the query.  When the service
   operator for the base URL has delegated authority for a resource to a
   third party, the operator will configure its RDAP service to redirect
   requests accordingly.

   The client may also be interested in the registration data that the
   original service operator has, though.  For example:

      the original service operator's responses may be in conformance
      with an externally-defined RDAP profile, such that the client
      finds them easier or more useful to deal with than the responses
      provided by the delegated service operator;

      the original service operator's responses may provide useful
      information about larger delegations of resources to delegated
      service operators;

      where both service operators record information about the same
      delegation (e.g. the same specific IP network), the delegated
      operator may omit some information recorded by the original
      operator which is useful to the client; or

      the delegated service may be unavailable for some reason, and the
      client may be content to rely on the data from the original
      service operator in that situation.

   It is already open to a service operator to return an RDAP object as
   the body of a redirect response: see section 6.4 of [RFC7231] and
   section 5.2 of [RFC7480], neither of which prohibits this behaviour.
   However, because this is unusual both in the RDAP context and more
   generally, this document defines the parameters of this behaviour, as
   well as a conformance code that can be used to signal that this
   behaviour is supported.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Implementation

   An RDAP service operator that implements this specification MUST
   include an RDAP object ([RFC7483]) as the body of any non-permanent
   (HTTP 302, 303, or 307) redirect response that it returns, whenever
   it records data in its own right about the requested resource, or
   about a resource for which a response may be validly returned for the
   requested resource (for example, a less-specific IP network object).

   An RDAP service operator that implements this specification MUST
   include the string literal "redirect_with_content" in the

   rdapConformance array of a "/help" response, as well as any redirect
   response that includes an RDAP object as its body.  The service
   operator MAY include this string literal in other responses.

3.  Security Considerations

   [RFC7481] describes security requirements and considerations for RDAP
   generally.  This specification does not introduce any new
   requirements/considerations past those defined in that document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following values in the RDAP
   Extensions Registry:

      Extension identifier: redirect_with_content

      Registry operator: Any

      Published specification: This document.

      Intended usage: COMMON

5.  Acknowledgements

   ARIN's RDAP service implements this behaviour when redirecting to
   other RIRs, which is what prompted consideration/documentation of
   this approach in the delegation context.
