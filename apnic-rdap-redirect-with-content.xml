            The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by
            Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name
            Registries (DNRs) to provide access to their resource
            registration information.  When an RDAP service operator
            has delegated authority for a resource to a third party,
            the operator will configure its RDAP service to redirect
            requests for that resource to the third party.  However,
            the client may be interested in the resource registration
            data that the first service operator has in its own right,
            for various reasons.  This document defines a conformance
            code that a service operator can use to indicate that when
            redirecting requests, it will also include as the body of
            the response the RDAP object (if any) that it has in its
            own right for the requested resource.

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>

            The <xref target="RFC7480">Registration Data Access
            Protocol (RDAP)</xref> is used by Regional Internet
            Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to
            provide access to their resource registration information.
            For a client, this typically involves following the
            bootstrap process <xref target="RFC7484" /> to determine
            the base URL for the query.  When the service operator for
            the base URL has delegated authority for a resource to a
            third party, the operator will configure its RDAP service
            to redirect requests accordingly.

        </t>

        <t>

            The client may also be interested in the registration data
            that the original service operator has, though.  For
            example:

            <list>
                <t>

                    the original service operator's responses may be
                    in conformance with an externally-defined RDAP
                    profile, such that the client finds them easier or
                    more useful to deal with than the responses
                    provided by the delegated service operator;

                </t>

                <t>

                    the original service operator's responses may
                    provide useful information about larger
                    delegations of resources to delegated service
                    operators;

                </t>

                <t>

                    where both service operators record information
                    about the same delegation (e.g. the same specific
                    IP network), the delegated operator may omit some
                    information recorded by the original operator
                    which is useful to the client; or

                </t>

                <t>

                    the delegated service may be unavailable for some
                    reason, and the client may be content to rely on
                    the data from the original service operator in
                    that situation.

                </t>
            </list>

        </t>

        <t>

            It is already open to a service operator to return an RDAP
            object as the body of a redirect response: see section 6.4
            of <xref target="RFC7231" /> and section 5.2 of <xref
            target="RFC7480" />, neither of which prohibits this
            behaviour.  However, because this is unusual both in the
            RDAP context and more generally, this document defines the
            parameters of this behaviour, as well as a conformance
            code that can be used to signal that this behaviour is
            supported.

    <section title="Implementation">
        <t>

            An RDAP service operator that implements this
            specification MUST include an RDAP object (<xref
            target="RFC7483" />) as the body of
            any non-permanent (HTTP 302, 303, or 307) redirect
            response that it returns, whenever it records data in its
            own right about the requested resource, or about a
            resource for which a response may be validly returned for
            the requested resource (for example, a less-specific IP
            network object).

        </t>

	<t>

            An RDAP service operator that implements this
            specification MUST include the string literal
            "redirect_with_content" in the rdapConformance array of a
            "/help" response, as well as any redirect response that
            includes an RDAP object as its body.  The service operator
            MAY include this string literal in other responses.

        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>

            <xref target="RFC7481" /> describes security requirements
            and considerations for RDAP generally.  This specification
            does not introduce any new requirements/considerations past those
            defined in that document.

            ARIN's RDAP service implements this behaviour when
            redirecting to other RIRs, which is what prompted
            consideration/documentation of this approach in the
            delegation context.
